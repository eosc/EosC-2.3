# Sample robots.txt file (make sure the filename is ALL LOWERCASE on Linux/Unix systems)
# This file should go in your web site's ROOT directory
#  The root directory is where your site's main /index.html file would be found
#  It is usually found in /yourhomedir/public_html/ or /yourhomedir/httpdocs
#  Where "yourhomedir" is your user account's name
